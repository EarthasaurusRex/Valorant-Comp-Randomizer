# Valorant Comp Randomizer

A web-based tool to generate random Valorant team compositions.

## Features

*   **True Random Mode:** Generates a completely random team composition from the entire agent pool.
*   **Decent Comp Mode:** Generates a somewhat-balanced team composition that includes every agent role. Takes into account of agents' pseudo-roles (e.g., Viper is a pseudo-Sentinel).
